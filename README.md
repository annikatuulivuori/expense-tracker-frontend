# 💸 Expense Tracker (frontend)

This is a frontend for a Java Spring Boot learning project. The purpose for this project was to learn more about TypeScript.

**small disclaimer:** I have not done anything to the ui design and styling of this project lol

## 📦 Technologies 
- `TypeScript`
- `React.js`

## ✨ Featrures

This expense tracker is quite simple. You can (for now) add new expenses. Every expense has a description and an amount. 
All expenses will be stored in a list within backend. As of right now, the expenses added will not save for later.

## 📚 Goals I had for this project

Before starting this project, I knew I had goals to learn new skills. Here is a list of detailed list of what I wanted to achieve:

- learn TypeScript syntac, concepts and best practices
- deepen understanding of React.js features
- learn to ingegrate backend (Java Springboot) to fetch data
- try bootstrap

**Did I achieve these goals?** Short answer is yes. Long asnwer is that this project is not perfect - and it shows. 

## 💭 How can this project be improved?

- add delete expense functionality (backend already has this)
- refine ui design
- add categories and color coding for different types of expenses
